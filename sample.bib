abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel study on the impact of lossy data compression on the metrological properties of holographic tomography reconstruction of the refractive index (RI). We use a spatial bandwidth-optimized compression procedure that leverages the properties of image plane off-axis holograms and standardized compression codecs, both widely applied in research and industry. The compression procedure is tested at multiple bitrates, for four different objects and against three reconstruction algorithms. The metrological evaluation is primarily done by comparison to the reconstruction from original data using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE). We show that due to differences between objects and different noise sensitivities of the reconstruction algorithms, the rate-distortion behaviour varies, but in most cases allows for the compression below 1 bit per pixel, while maintaining an RI RMSE less than 10\&\#x2212;4.},

abstract = {Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a therapeutic tool that uses the photobiochemical interaction between light and tissue. Its effectiveness is controversial due to a strong dependence on dosimetric parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that digital holographic microscopy is an effective label-free imaging technique to analyze the effects of LLLT on biological cells, and we propose the full methodology to create correct synthetic aperture phase maps for further extensive, highly accurate statistical analysis. The proposed methodology has been designed to provide a basis for many other biological experiments using quantitative phase imaging. We use SHSY-5Y and HaCaT cells irradiated with different doses of red light for the experiment. The analysis shows quantitative changes in cell dry mass density and the projected cell surface in response to different radiation doses.},
